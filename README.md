Is a part of previous version of the 
[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dobutokO-poetry-0.11.0.0](dobutokO-poetry) package 
version 0.11.0.0. Now is provided as a general package because of the 
possibility using the uniqueness-periods and uniqueness-periods-general 
packages provide the same functionality for both cases of Ukrainian and 
similar languages.

There are different languages. They have different structure and rules. 
But there is a possibility to create and use (on the one of 
the existing vastly used and well spread languages basis, in this work, 
the Ukrainian one) the "phonetic" language more suitable 
for poetry and music. Even there can be different variants of the phonetic 
language. This work proposes to create at least two 
new "phonetic" languages on the Ukrainian basis.

Imagine, you can understand the information in the text no matter of 
the words order and only with the most needed grammar 
preserved (for example, the rule not to separate the preposition and 
the next word is preserved). Understand just like you can 
read the text (after some instruction and training might be) 
with the words where only the first and the last letters 
are preserved on their places and the rest are interchangeably mixed. 
So imagine, you can understand (and express your thoughts, 
feeling, motives and so on) the message of the text with no strict 
word order preserved.

In such a case, you can rearrange words (preserving the most important 
rules in this case to reduce or even completely 
eliminate ambiguity) so that they can obtain more interesting phonetic 
sounding. You can try to create poetic (at least somewhat 
rhythmic and expressive) text or music. This can be an inspiring and 
developing exercise itself. But how can you quickly find out 
which combinations are more or less suitable? Besides, can the complexity 
of the algorithms be reduced?

These are some of the interesting questions. The work does not at 
the moment answers them, but is experimental, still may be valuable.

Ukrainian is the language with no strict words order needed (though 
there do exist some preferences in it) and have rather 
pleasant sounding. So it can be a good example and instance. Besides 
for the author it is a native language.

Even if you would not like to create and use "phonetic" languages 
where phonetics is of more importance than the grammar, then you 
can evaluate the phonetic potential of the words used in the text 
in producing specially sounding texts. This can also be helpful 
in poetry writing and other probably related fields.
